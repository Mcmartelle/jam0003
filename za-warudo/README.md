# Za Warudo lang

Assemble a beautiful world, using an assembly-like language.

Za Warudo is a highly domain-specific language, used to generate random 2D worlds by simply specifying its properties.

## The language

Za warudo is a simple language. It starts with the keyword `world`:
```
world world_name
```

Then you specify the map legend, one on each line. These will be used later.
```
legend legend_name #<color-as-hex-code>
```

For example, `legend sand #ceae7f`.

A world is made up of several regions. Specify a new region using:
```
region region_name
```

Then specify what percentage of the world is taken up by the region:
```
region_name 50%
```

The region can then be divided into components, each colored by an entry in the legend:
```
region_name legend_name 25%
```

### A complete example

(this is also the default example when you open the webapp)

```
world hello

legend sand #ceae7f
legend rock_lower #41474a
legend rock_upper #2B7A0B
legend water_deep #2ebdbd
legend water_shallow #608fc7

region island
island 40%
island rock_lower 25%
island rock_upper 25%
island sand 50%

region water
water 60%
water water_deep 50%
water water_shallow 50%
```
