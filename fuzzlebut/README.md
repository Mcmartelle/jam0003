# Origin of the name
I have a bunny named Jaclyn, but we sometimes call her "Princess Fuzzlebutt."

# Pronounciation
Although the name is spelled Fūzzlebūt, it is pronounced like foozleboot. The diacritics alter the 'u' and make it more of an "oo" sound. The exact linguistic meaning is irrelevant though because it is supposed to sound like foozleboot.

# Interpretation of "Beautiful Assembly"
The [Merriam-Webster dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/assembly) lists
> a collection of parts so assembled
as a definition of "assembly," so I interpreted the theme as "a beautiful collection of parts."
In this case, parts are functions and cells.
