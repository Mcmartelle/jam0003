# tmp-lang

Some unwritten language...

## General idea

Lambda calculus, but a visual drag-n-drop application, a bit like MIT Scratch

## Theme: beautiful assembly

Putting blocks together counts as assembly

The beautiful part, is animating the reductions


## How to run:

```bash
cargo run --release
```
(may need some graphics libraries, should be fine on windows)
